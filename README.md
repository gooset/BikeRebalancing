# Bike Rebalancing Optimization Project

This project tackles the **bike rebalancing problem**: ensuring bikes are optimally distributed across stations in a bike-sharing network, balancing availability with minimized operational costs.

Two methods are implemented in **both Julia and Python**:
1. **Simulated Annealing** - A heuristic approach to explore solutions iteratively.
2. **Branch and Bound** - An optimization approach to find an exact solution.

All data files are stored in the instances folder for consistency.
